git clean

The git clean command removes untracked files from your working directory. This is really more of a convenience command, since it’s trivial to see which files are untracked with git status and remove them manually. Like an ordinary rm command, git clean is not undoable, so make sure you really want to delete the untracked files before you run it.

The git clean command is often executed in conjunction with git reset --hard. Remember that resetting only affects tracked files, so a separate command is required for cleaning up untracked ones. COMBINED, THESE TWO COMMANDS LET YOU RETURN THE WORKING DIRECTORY TO THE EXACT STATE OF A PARTICULAR COMMIT.

Usage
git clean -n
Perform a “dry run” of git clean. This will show you which files are going to be removed without actually doing it.

git clean -f
Remove untracked files from the current directory. The -f (force) flag is required unless the clean.requireForce configuration option is set to false (it's true by default).
