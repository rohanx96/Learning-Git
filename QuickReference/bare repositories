Bare Repositories
The --bare flag creates a repository that doesnâ€™t have a working directory, making it impossible to edit files and commit changes in that repository. Central repositories should always be created as bare repositories because pushing branches to a non-bare repository has the potential to overwrite changes. Think of --bare as a way to mark a repository as a storage facility, opposed to a development environment. This means that for virtually all Git workflows, the central repository is bare, and developers local repositories are non-bare.

Since git clone is a more convenient way to create local copies of a project, the most common use case for git init is to create a central repository:
git init --bare my-project.git
