# Learning-Git

My first attempt at Git Version Control

Learning the basics of Git. Committing and pushing. Previous line committed but not pushed.
Will now push the changes.

**confusion of staging before committing. Required me to add the file again after the first commit to make the second commit. will try again.

Results:
Only commited changes are pushed. The above statement was not committed before the first push so the changes were not reflected online. And you need to stage (add the file) before committing.  

*changed through new branch
